How different are your services from a blind date set up by friends?
The matches we choose for you are carefully screened and selected to match with your desires and expectations, as opposite to introductions through friends when all they have in mind is that you are both single and are looking to meet someone.

 We also help you to make the right choice. The problem is that everyone has a pattern they use in the relationships. What we call chemistry is actually sitting deep in unconscious and is hard wired. It determines your relationships choices for the rest of your life.

 

Because of it, you crave specific types of people and situations whether they are good for you or not. You will continue to do this unless you do something to change your hard wiring. You cannot change your wiring by reading a book. If you could you would have exactly the kind of relationships you want by now. Only method that imprint the original primal level and interrupt your original wiring can change your relationship patterns and finally help you to find what you deserve and desire for yourself

I'm incredibly busy and barely have time for myself.
How do you meet new people in your life? Through friends?… At parties?... In a bar?… At your sports club?… On a blind date?… or possibly on-line? All of these approaches can be entertaining for a while, but in a long run, they are all a waste of time. With our fast-paced lifestyles and living in an era of high technology and booming internet services, more people are finding traditional matchmakers to be an easier and more convenient way to find the love of their life.

What is the difference between The Singles Club 876 and On-line Dating?
Did you know that approximately 50% of the people that do Internet dating are married or are in committed relationships? After spending hours on line you will find out that most of the people you meet online often do not turn out to be as they portrayed themselves – they post photos of themselves taken 20 years ago or often not even their own pictures, etc.


While dating online, you will have to take risks on yourself and to verify if the information presented online is accurate or take chances to meet total strangers. Most people prefer to know that the stranger they're going out with has already been through a background check. Research shows that less than 1% of online singles ever make a love connection. Online dating can be very time-consuming. Our service is stress-free, financially beneficial and efficient.
